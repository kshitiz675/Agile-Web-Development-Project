# Agile-Web-Development-Project - Crypto College

An interactive website for learning about cryptocurrency through lessons and assesments.

## Description

This web application was created as part of a project for the CITS3403 unit at The University of Western Australia. It aims to provide an interactive learning experience on the topic of cryptocurrencies in which users can test their learning and compare it with others. Users may register or login to begin learning on the website and select lessons from a range of 5 topics, the blockchain, NFTs, crypto-mining, cryptocurrencies and the uses of cryptocurrencies. Upon logging in, the topics will be available to select at the learn page. After selecting a topic, users will be given a short video and summary notes to learn from. On completion, a three question quiz will be taken and a feedback of results will be given. These results may be visible on the world leaderboard for the website.
